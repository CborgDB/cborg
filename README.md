CborgDB is üöß still under development üöß and will be a database management system.
The database will be developed in C language and the project is open source on üêô GitHub.

The purpose of CborgDB is to learn how existing database management systems work under the hood and maybe be able to do something different. Currently, CborgDB doesn't do anything interesting but you have the right to try it üòú.
